Please follow the guidelines below to make the contribution process as smooth as possible.

Style guide
---

### Branch Naming

We use the [Git-Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.
The branch names are prefixed with `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `docs/` or `ci/`.
The `main` branch is the stable branch. Your pull requests should be made against the `main` branch.

### Commit Convention

All of commits should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention.
This convention is used to generate the changelog and bump project version by `commitizen`.
So, please follow the convention when you commit.

### Code Style

All of code should follow the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
The [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks are defined in [pre-commit](.pre-commit-config.yaml) config file.
The hooks will check and format the code style automatically when you commit.
If you don't know how to use pre-commit, please refer [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage).

### Pull Request

The title of the pull request should be the same as the title of the branch.
If branch name is `feature/awesome-feature`, the title of the pull request should be `feat: awesome feature`.

Dependency Management
---

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
Our dependencies are defined in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file and [poetry.lock](poetry.lock) file.
Do not edit this file manually. If you want to add or remove dependencies, please use `poetry add` or `poetry remove` command.

### Activate virtual environment

```bash
poetry shell
```

This command will activate the virtual environment and install all dependencies.

### Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install --with all # install all of group dependencies
```

Our dependencies are divided into 3 groups: `dev`, `test`, and `docs`.
If you want to install only `dev` dependencies, please use `poetry install --with dev` command.

How to develop

Versioning
---

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository. 
The version bump is done by `commitizen` and the Github Actions. If you want to see this mechanism,
please refer our [bump-version](.github/workflows/bump-version.yml) action
or commitizen [documentation](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/).
